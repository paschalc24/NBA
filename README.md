üèÄ NBA Game Simulation API

## Overview

This API facilitates local CRUD operations for NBA game simulations, offering endpoints for data retrieval, simulation execution, result updates, and deletion. Simulations consist of team-name-score pairs predicted through multivariate linear regression. The API enables the selection of independent variables from a specified list of basketball statistics for precise and tailorable simulation generation.

## Error Responses

In case of errors, the API may return the following responses:

- **Status Code 400:** Bad Request
- **Status Code 404:** Not Found
- **Status Code 500:** Internal Server Error

- All simulation data is stored in the 'out.json' file.

## Note

After there is a reasonable data in the current season the data will dynamically be pulled from this season. I also plan on adding an endpoint to run a similar prediction using Monte Carlo simulations.
Advice is always appreciated, thank you üôåüèº
